In each step, you may remove items in several cells, provided that they form a consecutive sequence of 3 or more of the same item in the same row or column.\n3. Once the item in a cell is removed, it leaves a blank cell, represented by \"#\".\nBased on the rules, you should generate a 6x6 grid filled with 3 different kinds of items (A, B, and C) as the initial setup and play the game for one step: If you can identify items that form a sequence of 3 or more of the same item in a row or column, leaving blank cells (\"#\") in their place and generating the resulting grid; if you cannot find such a sequence, explain it.",
